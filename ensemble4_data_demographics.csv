So I try to compensate in my life. If I catch myself thinking things that are prejudiced, I correct myself and remind myself that we're all human. I worked at a school where I was one of a handful of white people after I graduated college. My students were sweet, lovely human beings,  and I'm so glad that I had that experience because now I see people I know in strange faces. (""That man walking down the street towards me looks like my student, X. I wonder what he's up to."" And then I feel less afraid.) I always remind myself to think twice before judging someone. It was hard to complete this survey because rating people on trustworthiness is difficult. I don't want to outright trust or distrust anyone. I like to talk to someone first. I'm more inclined to trust people if they look happy, I think. Some of the faces looked threatening. Some of the women I might have trusted, but I'm not sure because I've had some bad experiences with other white women in the past, so that makes me more neutral. I just felt bad for all of the pictures where there was clear photoshopping going on. I felt like if someone really looked like that, they might have a disability, which wouldn't make me trust them necessarily; I'd want to protect them rather than give them responsibility. Some of the pretty people, I wondered if they would be manipulative, but I did feel maybe more inclined to trust them.",429820,
